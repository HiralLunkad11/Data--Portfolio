Bank loans are a crucial financial tool that enables individuals and businesses to achieve their goals and manage financial needs. Banks collect loan data through various channels and processes.
Reasons for Analysing Bank Loan Data:
Banks analyse loan data for several critical reasons:
Risk Assessment: One of the primary purposes of analysing loan data is to assess the risk associated with lending to a particular individual or business. Banks use data to evaluate the creditworthiness of borrowers, predict default probabilities, and determine interest rates and lending terms.
Decision-making: Loan data analysis supports the decision-making process when evaluating loan applications. Banks use data-driven models and algorithms to make informed lending decisions, such as approving or denying loan requests.
Portfolio Management: Banks manage portfolios of loans, including mortgages, personal loans, and business loans. Data analysis helps banks monitor the health of these portfolios, identify underperforming loans, and optimize loan terms and pricing.

In this Project I have analyzed the bank loan dataset utilizing SQL queries and then performing data visualizations in POWER BI.
